## Running the Application: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install GitHub Desktop
   - If you haven't already, download and install GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

### 2. Create a folder to hold your repository 
   - Choose or create a folder on your local machine where you want to store your project repository.

### 3. Clone the Repository into that folder
   - Open GitHub Desktop, navigate to the "File" menu, and select "Clone Repository".
   - Choose the repository you want to clone from the list or paste its URL.
   - Specify the local path (the folder you created in step 2) where you want to clone the repository.
   - Click on "Clone".

### 4. Open in Unity
   - Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the folder where it's located on your machine.
   - Open Unity, then open the project by selecting the folder you just cloned.

   Note: If you prefer using the terminal, you can perform these steps there, but proceed with caution if you're less familiar with it.
